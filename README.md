## Files for advanced users
* optionally, before creating new Ubuntu edit crucial.rc file (~/Downloads/crouton-crucial-master/crucial.rc)
* crucial.rc: annotated runcom file for Crouton environments; required by crucial.sh; edit this first
* crucial.sh: starts a Crouton chroot; optionally first installing, backing up, or updating
* keepawake.sh: a wrapper script optionally called by crucial.sh that disables suspend before enter-chroot
