#Developer Mode

For the following devices, you’ll want to power your device off, find the recovery button press and hold the button, then power on the device while holding the recovery button.
* LG Chromebase
* Asus Chromebox
* Acer AC700
* CR-48
* Samsung Series 5
* Samsung Series 5 550
* Samsung Series 3 Chromebox

For all other devices, Press Esc+Refresh then hold down the Power button while the unit is powered ON. This will take you into what’s called ‘recovery mode’ and looks scary. It says “Chrome os is either missing or damaged”. On this screen, press ctrl + d. This brings up another screen that says to press enter to enable developer mode. Press enter. That’s it, just wait for it to do it’s thing.

## IMPORTANT! 
Now that you’re in Developer Mode, everytime you start up your device you’re going to see a screen you’re not used to. It’s going to tell you that something is disabled, and to press the space bar to re-enable it. DO NOT PRESS THE SPACE BAR. Just wait. Your device will beep a couple times, then it will boot up like normal. You can press ctrl + d if you want, and that will skip the beeping part and you’ll boot up a few seconds faster, but it’s not required. Just do NOT press the space bar. If you press the space bar, it will undo everything we just did.
